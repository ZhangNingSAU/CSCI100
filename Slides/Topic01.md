# 1. What is Computer?

## 1.1 Computers are everywhere.
+ The modern electronic computer is certainly one of the most influential inventions of the twentieth century.
+ Computers have entered almost every arena of human society. They operate in our homes, our workplaces, and our schools. They come in so many shapes and sizes that it is sometimes difficult to recognize them: while laptop and desktop computers are commonplace, ATM machinecomputers can also be found in home electronics, automobiles, airplanes, automatic teller machines (ATMs), security systems, and many other devices and situations. Many of the world's societies depend heavily on computers in the operation of their transportation systems, commerce, utilities, law enforcement, governance, and more.

## 1.2 What is computer?
+ A computer is an electronic device, operating the instructions stored in its own memory.
+ A computer can accept data, process the data, produce results, and store the results for future use.
+ A typical computer architecture
  - Note that 
Primary memory usually refers to Random Access Memory (RAM), while secondary storage refers to devices such as hard disk drives, solid state drives, removable “USB” drives, CDs, and DVDs.

## 1.3 Information Processing Cycle

+ Data v.s. Information
  - **Data** is a collection of unprocessed items, which can include text, numbers, images and so on.
  - **Information** conveys meaning and is useful to people.

+ Example
  - At a restaurant, a single customer’s bill amount is data. However, when the restaurant owners collect and interpret multiple bills over a range of time, they can produce valuable information, such as what menu items are most popular and whether the prices are sufficient to cover supplies, overhead, and wages.
  - Data Mining - Clustering

## 1.4 Four Functions about computer
+ The four functions of a computer actually explain the core reasons why it was built. They include:
  - Data input
  - Data processing.
  - Information output.
  - Data and information storage.

### 1.4.1 Data Input
+ Every computer is designed with data input as a first function, an activity which is accomplished via input devices.
+ Data entry is done manually, automatically or both. Manual input is done via add-on peripherals like the keyboard, mouse and stylus. Input can also be accomplished via vocal dictation applications and body gestures peripherals like Kinect and biometric devices. Elsewhere, data input is also done using secondary storage media and networking interfaces.
+ Application software used for this purpose will also dictate what data is entered. Word processing software is designed to input basic alphanumerical data, while a photo editing application is used to input and manipulate images.
+ Automated applications and robotics can also be used to intelligently feed data into the computer on station or remotely. As an example, tallying of electoral process can be accomplished remotely and automatically.

### 1.4.2 Data Processing
+ Data processing is the core function of a computer. Processing involves manipulation of raw data into before converting it into meaningful information. Usually, data is in raw form, and will thus undergo processing before dissemination for user consumption.
+ The 'brain' of the computer where data is processed is referred to as the microprocessor. It is also commonly known as the central processing unit (CPU) or accelerated processing unit (APU).
+ The processing chips in modern personal computing devices continue to evolve and outperform its predecessors. One particular evolution is the merger of microprocessor and graphics processing unit (GPU) into what is now known as accelerated processing unit. The merger allows for the integration of powerful graphics processing abilities inside the traditional arithmetic and logical computations of the processor.
+ Besides the microprocessor, the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and static random access memory (SRAM) are integral parts of data processing. Data entered via input devices is stored temporarily in DRAM, then transferred to SRAM from where the microprocessor manipulates it.

### 1.4.3 Information Output
+ When raw data has been manipulated by the microprocessor, the outcome is meant to be disseminated for useful purposes. The output is thus referred to as information and is beneficial to the computer user.
+ Processed data or information can be
  - viewed as alphanumeric, images and video via a display hardware
  - listened to as audio files by use of a speaker
  - printed as hard copy output onto paper
  - printed as 3D models

### 1.4.4 Data and Information Storage
+ A computer can store information internally and externally. The hard disk drive (HDD) and/or solid-state disk drive (SSD) are internal storage devices and serve to protect and house all data and information on a computer. In bigger systems, the RAID system is used. Multiple disk drives operate simultaneously to ensure data and information integrity.
+ External storage is achieved through accessories that attach externally to the computer. They include external drives and optical disks.
+ Better still data and information can be stored online in cloud solutions for a fee or for a fee if large space is required.
+ Storage integrity is a crucial phase that can actually determine the worth of a computer system. 

## 1.5 Fundamentals of Computer Systems: Hardware and Software
+ **Hardware** - Physical components that make up a computer system.
+ **Software** - Computer programs and related data that provide the instructions for telling computer hardware what to do and how to do it.
